# inverse-binary-matrix
Little program that computes the inverse of a binary matrix by gaussian elimination.

Created to solve part of the "Nintendo HireMe.c" challenge. I needed to calculate the inverse of a binary matrix to reverse some XOR mutations.
At the end the inversed matrix was equal to the input matrix, but I only could figure it out by calculating.

I didn't find any place or code to calculate the inverse of a binary matrix. This only works for rectangular matrix NxN.
