# INVERSE BINARY MATRIX CALCULATOR
Little program that computes the inverse of a binary matrix by gaussian elimination. This only works for rectangular matrix NxN.

Created to solve part of the "Nintendo HireMe.c" challenge.
I needed to calculate the inverse of a binary matrix to reverse some XOR mutations. At the end the inversed matrix was equal to the input matrix, but I only could figure it out by calculating the inverse.

I didn't find any place or code to calculate the inverse of a binary matrix so here is my code.
